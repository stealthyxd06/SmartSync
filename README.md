# SmartSync

SmartSync is just a project of mine I have to learn to code in python. got the idea from Jarvis from Ironman movie

setup:

simply download the file and open it

then just start the code using any editor (Preferbly VS code)

also change the path to your path as it can be diffrent for each person.


To Do:

Voice recognition

Automatic task scheduling, and ability to set reminders

Integration with various APIs and services (such as weather, news, and calendar) to provide information and perform tasks

A simple user interface, such as a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).
